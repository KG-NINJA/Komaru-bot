All tasks are completed! Here's what I did:

### Files Created

1. **HTML App**: `apps/latest_app/index.html`
   - A minimal standalone app that provides a consultation resource for social insurance and working styles. It features:
     - A calming blue color design.
     - JavaScript for client-side logic.
     - Natural Japanese text.
     - A footer with the "#KGNINJA AutoApp" signature.

2. **README File**: `apps/latest_app/README.md`
   - Contains a brief description and usage instructions.

### Next Steps

You can now run the HTML file in a browser to see the app in action. If you need any further modifications or additional features, feel free to ask!
